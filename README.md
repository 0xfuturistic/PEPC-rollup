# ðŸ”´ OP Stack Sequencer Commitments

**A hack for the OP-Stack introducing sophisticated sequencer commitments.**

Users that will become sequencers can enter into commitments in the EVM by using Emily, a library for manging commitments in the EVM developed for PEPC. This hack is a proof of concept for the OP-Stack, and it is not intended to be used in production.

## Why This Matters
This initiative bridges the capabilities of Layer 1 and Layer 2, ensuring sequencers can make, manage, and fulfill commitments, ultimately fostering transparency and reliability in transaction ordering.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features
- **Dynamic Commitments**: Sequencers as user accounts can initiate commitments in the L1.
- **L2 Reinforcement**: Commitments made by sequencers are enforced in L2, powered by a predetermined L1 contract.
- **Flexible Design**: Sequencers can make commitments even if they weren't conceived during L2 contract deployment.
- **Solidity Integration**: Commitments are anchored in L1 and stored as tuples of a function and a target, leveraging PEPC's Emily library.

## ðŸ›   Potential Use Cases:

1. **Dynamic Transaction Integration**: Facilitate sequencer commitments for incorporating transactions with attributes not pre-defined during L1 contract instantiation.
2. **Selective Transaction Exclusion**: Allow sequencers to commit to omitting specific transactions, ensuring a filtered transaction stream.
3. **Customized Transaction Ordering**: Empower L2 with programmable sequencing policies, offering tailored transaction processing patterns.
4. **MEV Mitigation Strategy**: Deploy advanced mechanisms in the EVM to counteract Miner Extractable Value vulnerabilities, enhancing network security.
5. **Versatile Contractual Commitments**: Design and deploy L1-L2 interoperable contracts, facilitating granular interaction between sequencers and third parties, backed by EVM-defined satisfaction parameters.
6. **Front-Running Prevention**: Leveraging commitments to prevent front-running by fixing the transaction inclusion order, thereby precluding sequencers from exploiting user transactions based on privileged information.
8. **Atomic Swaps**: Description: Facilitating atomic swaps by sequencing multi-step transactions in a particular order to ensure either successful swaps or no transaction at all.
9. **Commitments to Layered Prioritization**: Different categories of transactions (like urgent, premium, standard) can be sequenced based on their priorities.
10. **Fair Sequencing Services**: Introducing fairness in transaction ordering to minimize MEV and foster a more equitable transaction environment.


## âš™ Technical Blueprint
**Harnessing Emily for Sequencer Commitments**

### Client's Perspective:
The `OnUnsafeL2Payload` function, at the heart of the client's stack, is responsible for assimilating new blocks. This is now integrated with the call to `n.validateCommitments(ctx, payload)`, ensuring every block respects its sequencer commitments. All of these are brought to life in the EVM with Emily's prowess.

**Insightful Code Snippets**:
```go
// In op-node/node/node.go
func (n *OpNode) OnUnsafeL2Payload(ctx context.Context, from peer.ID, payload *eth.ExecutionPayload) error {
    // Essential operations...

    // Commitments check
    if err := n.validateCommitments(ctx, payload); err != nil {
        return err
    }
    // Concluding operations...
}
```

```go
// Residing in op-node/node/pepc.go
func (n *OpNode) validateCommitments(ctx context.Context, payload *eth.ExecutionPayload) error {
    // Convert payload to bytecode
    payloadBytes, err := n.encodePayload(payload)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }

    // Invoke the Screener
    satisfied, err := instance.Screen(nil, n.runCfg.P2PSequencerAddress(), *n.target(), payloadBytes)

    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    if !satisfied {
        return errors.New("ScreeningFailed")
    }
}
```

### EVM's Role:
At the core of the EVM lies Emily's Screener contract, a guardian ensuring commitments are upheld.

```solidity
contract Screener {
    /// @notice Checks if the account's commitments are satisfied by the value being written.
    /// @param account The account that is writing the value.
    /// @param target The target to which the value is being written.
    /// @param value The value being written.
    /// @return True if the account's commitments are satisfied by the value being written, false otherwise.
    function screen(address account, bytes32 target, bytes memory value) public view virtual returns (bool) {
        return commitmentManager.areAccountCommitmentsSatisfiedByValue(account, target, value, block.timestamp);
    }
}
```
It's important to note that the sequencer even though is constrained in their behavior by the commitment may choose not to provide their signature in the first place. So the sequencer can't be forced to act in a particular way. Rather, we prevent them from doing taking certain actions by rejecting their payloads when they don't respect their commitments.
