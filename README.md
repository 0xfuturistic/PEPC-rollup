# ðŸ”´ OP Stack Sequencer Commitments

**A hack for the OP Stack introducing sequencer commitments.**

![Alt Text](cover.gif)

Users that will become sequencers can enter into commitments in the EVM by leveraging [Emily](https://github.com/0xfuturistic/emily), a library for managing commitments on-chain developed for [PEPC-DVT](https://ethresear.ch/t/pepc-dvt-pepc-with-no-changes-to-the-consensus-protocol/16514). This hack is a proof of concept for the [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/), and it is not intended to be used in production.

## Why This Matters
This initiative bridges the capabilities of Layer 1 and Layer 2, ensuring sequencers can make, manage, and fulfill commitments, ultimately fostering transparency and reliability in transaction ordering and powering general-purpose contracting between sequencers and third parties.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features
- **Dynamic Commitments**: Sequencers, as accounts, can enter into commitments in the L1.
- **L2 Enforcement**: Commitments made by sequencers are enforced on L2 blocks, with the logic outsourced to a a predetermined L1 contract.
- **Flexible Design**: Sequencers can make commitments even if they weren't conceived during L2 contract deployment. Because of the EVM, commitments as programs are Turing-complete and can rely on any on-chain data.
- **Solidity Integration**: Commitments are anchored in L1 and stored as tuples of a function and a target, leveraging PEPC-DVT's model. This allows for commitments to be defined in Solidity, and for the EVM to be used as a commitment manager.

## ðŸ›   Potential Use Cases:

1. **Dynamic Transaction Inclusion**: Facilitate sequencer commitments for the inclusion of transactions with attributes defined after L2 deployment.
3. **Customized Transaction Ordering**: Empower L2 with programmable sequencing policies, offering tailored transaction processing patterns.
4. **MEV Mitigation**: Design strategies in Solidity to mitigate MEV by leveraging commitments to sequence transactions in a particular way.
5. **General-purpose Contracts**: Design and deploy L1-L2 interoperable contracts, facilitating granular interaction between sequencers and third parties, backed by EVM-defined commitments.
6. **Front-Running Prevention**: Leveraging commitments to prevent front-running by committing to including a transaction as the first in the block or with only some specific transactions before it.
8. **Multi-Chain Atomic Operations**: Facilitating atomic operations by sequencing multi-step transactions in a particular order to ensure either successful operations or no transaction at all.
9. **Commitments to Layered Prioritization**: Different categories of transactions (like urgent, premium, standard) can be sequenced based on their priorities.
10. **_Sequencing Services_**: Introducing features such as fairness in transaction ordering to minimize MEV and foster a more equitable transaction environment.

## ðŸ”™ Background Readings
 I recommend checking out this [thread](https://twitter.com/0xfuturistic/status/1697306608722915518) and the piece introducing [PEPC-DVT](https://ethresear.ch/t/pepc-dvt-pepc-with-no-changes-to-the-consensus-protocol/16514). You can learn more about Emily [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/pepc-dvt-pepc-with-no-changes-to-the-consensus-protocol/16514#emily-a-protocol-for-credible-commitments-14).

 You can see a sample commitment for sequencer [here](https://github.com/0xfuturistic/sequencer-commitments/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/commitments/samples/FeeRecipientCommitment.sol). This commitment allows the sequencer to commit to fee recipients for specific blocks.

## âš™ Technical Blueprint
### In the Rollup Client
The `OnUnsafeL2Payload` function, at the heart of the client's stack (`op-node`), is responsible for processing new payloads. This function now integrates a call that validates payloads for commitment satisfaction. The logic for these commitments is implemented in the EVM by Emily.

```go
// In op-node/node/node.go
func (n *OpNode) OnUnsafeL2Payload(ctx context.Context, from peer.ID, payload *eth.ExecutionPayload) error {
    ...
    // Commitments check
    if err := n.validateCommitments(ctx, payload); err != nil {
        return err
    }
    ...
}
```

```go
// In op-node/node/pepc.go
func (n *OpNode) validateCommitments(ctx context.Context, payload *eth.ExecutionPayload) error {
    ...
    // Convert payload to bytecode
    payloadBytes, err := n.encodePayload(payload)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }

    // Invoke the Screener
    satisfied, err := instance.Screen(nil, n.runCfg.P2PSequencerAddress(), *n.target(), payloadBytes)

    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    if !satisfied {
        return errors.New("ScreeningFailed")
    }
}
```

### In the L1
Leveraging Emily's [Screener contract](https://github.com/0xfuturistic/emily/blob/main/src/Screener.sol), we filter the payloads that don't satisfy the sequencer's commitments. The rollup's system config inherits from this contract and implements a `screen` function responsible for checking whether the commitments of the sequencer are satisfied by the payload being screened. Screener does this by invoking the `areAccountCommitmentsSatisfiedByValue` function of a [CommitmentManager contract](https://github.com/0xfuturistic/emily/blob/main/src/CommitmentManager.sol), which is responsible for storing and managing commitments.

```solidity
contract Screener {
    /// @notice Checks if the account's commitments are satisfied by the value being written.
    /// @param account The account that is writing the value.
    /// @param target The target to which the value is being written.
    /// @param value The value being written.
    /// @return True if the account's commitments are satisfied by the value being written, false otherwise.
    function screen(address account, bytes32 target, bytes memory value) public view virtual returns (bool) {
        return commitmentManager.areAccountCommitmentsSatisfiedByValue(account, target, value, block.timestamp);
    }
}
```
It's also worth noting that even though they are constrained in their behavior by their commitments, a sequencer may choose not to provide their signature in the first place. So the sequencer can't be forced to act in a particular way. Rather, we prevent them from doing so in specific ways (i.e., in ways that violate their commitments).
